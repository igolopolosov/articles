#### **[Language, Awesome]** - [Worse is Better](http://dreamsongs.com/WIB.html) by [Richard P. Gabriel](http://dreamsongs.com/)
It's really exciting to see old days thoughts about software engineering.

It's unbelievable, what's happened last 28 years! Just some `old problems - current solutions` from this article:

- AI - Lisp was good lang for AI in 1991, wow! Now Python conquer the world üêç
- OS - Linux has been published after that article written, in 1991
- Env problem - Hello, Docker! üêã
- Worldwide collaboration - Hello, git and GitHub!

#### **[Testing, Really Good]** - [Node.js & JavaScript Testing Best Practices](https://medium.com/@me_37286/yoni-goldberg-javascript-nodejs-testing-best-practices-2b98924c9347)
Good points bout black box testing and using mocks/stubs. I like format, how this article is structured to sections. Dead-simple test approach is my lovable one.

### November 2018 

#### **[Testing, Good]** - [What to test and not to test by Mark Seemann](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/11/12/what-to-test-and-not-to-test/)
Reasonable and useful. Author talks about different experiences writing tests and he compares the different approaches.

#### **[Testing,  Really Bad]** - [Testing like a Pro in JavaScript by Alex Jover Morales](https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/testing-in-javascript/)
Big title, but the content is confusing, it's a nightmare to be honest. It could easily damage newbee developers and give them wrong understadning about testing, practices, agreements.
