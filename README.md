**[Testing, Good]** - [What to test and not to test by Mark Seemann](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/11/12/what-to-test-and-not-to-test/)
- Reasonable and useful. Author talks about different experiences writing tests and he compares the different approaches.

**[Testing,  Really Bad]** - [Testing like a Pro in JavaScript by Alex Jover Morales](https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/testing-in-javascript/)
- Big title, but the content is confusing, it's a nightmare to be honest. It could easily damage newbee developers and give them wrong understadning about testing, practices, agreements.
